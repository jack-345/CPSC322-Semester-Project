# Agriculture and Climate Change
For this project, we used a fully synthetic dataset from Kaggle. It contains mostly continuous data. It has 15 total attributes and 10,000 instances. We tried to classify if a crop yield was Low, Medium, or High as labels because there was no existing attribute appropriate for prediction.

## Running Instructions
* install numpy and other additional dependencies
* run "run_eda.py" file to perform EDA and generate graphs in "figures" folder

## Project Organization
* classifiers inside "mysklearn" directory
* dataset CSV file in root directory of repository
* general purpose functions used in mysklearn files inside "myutils.py"
* unit test files in root directory of repository
* geaphs and other visualizations generated and stored in "figures" directory
