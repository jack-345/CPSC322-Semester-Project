    "## Potential Impact From Results\n",
    "Why the results will be useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "Climate change is already having profound consequences on the global agricultural sector. Farmers depend on reliable, consistent weather patterns to plan when to plant, irrigate, protect, and harvest their crops. Unfortunately, climate change has disrupted these patterns and increased the frequency of extreme and severe weather events. This growing unpredictability leads to billions of dollars in crop losses each year, reduces global food supply stability, and places significant financial strain on agricultural communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing this synthetic dataset, we can practice identifying patterns between agricultural attributes and climate-related factors (including extreme weather). The insights gained here: about which variables matter, how to handle missing or imbalanced data, and how classification algorithms respond to climate-related features can directly inform how future real-world datasets on agriculture and climate change should be explored. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for building predictive tools that can help farmers, policymakers, and researchers make more informed decisions in the face of rapidly changing environmental conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of this project can provide insight into how climate variables most strongly influence agricultural outcomes. Understanding the relationships between temperature, precipitation, CO₂, soil conditions, and yield can help researchers build more effective predictive tools. These insights may guide future farming policy, disaster preparedness, and long-term planning in agriculture. Although this dataset is synthetic, the techniques developed here can be applied to real-world climate–crop datasets.\n",
