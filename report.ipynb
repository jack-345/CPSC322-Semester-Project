    "Figure 1: Target Variable Distributions\n",
    "Figure 1 shows the distribution of our target variable, Crop Yield. The left histogram displays the continuous yield values ranging from approximately 0.86 to 5 MT/HA, with vertical lines marking the 33rd percentile (1.68 MT/HA) and 67th percentile (2.66 MT/HA) that we used as category boundaries. The right bar chart confirms our categorization resulted in a balanced three-class problem with Low (33.1%), Medium (33.9%), and High (33.1%) yields approximately equally represented. This balanced distribution is crucial for training unbiased classification models, as it ensures that no single class dominates the dataset and that our classifiers will have equal opportunity to learn patterns for all three yield categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2:\n",
    "Figure 2 presents the distributions of four key climate variables in our dataset. The temperature distribution shows values ranging from approximately -5°C to 35°C with a relatively uniform spread, though there is a noticeable gap in data around 10-20°C which may indicate either missing data or regional climate patterns where certain temperature ranges are less common in agricultural areas. Precipitation displays an even distribution from 0 to 3000mm annually, suggesting the dataset captures diverse climatic conditions from arid to high-rainfall regions. CO2 emissions show a uniform distribution between 0 and 30 MT, indicating consistent representation across different emission levels. Extreme weather events are also uniformly distributed from 0 to 6 events, with all frequency levels equally represented. The uniformity of these distributions suggests the dataset was carefully balanced or synthetically generated to ensure equal representation across all climate conditions, which is beneficial for training classifiers that can generalize across diverse environmental scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3:\n",
    "Figure 3 displays the distributions of four agricultural practice variables: irrigation access, pesticide use, fertilizer use, and soil health index. Irrigation access shows a uniform distribution across the full range from 0% to 100%, indicating the dataset includes farms with no irrigation infrastructure as well as those with complete irrigation coverage. Pesticide use is evenly distributed from 0 to 50 KG/HA, representing diverse farming approaches from organic or low-input systems to conventional high-input agriculture. Fertilizer use similarly shows uniform distribution from 0 to 100 KG/HA, capturing the full spectrum of nutrient management practices. The soil health index ranges from approximately 30 to 100 with consistent frequency across all values, representing soil conditions from poor to excellent. The remarkably uniform distributions across all four variables suggest this dataset was synthetically generated or carefully balanced to ensure equal representation of different agricultural practices. This uniformity is advantageous for machine learning as it provides our classifiers with sufficient examples across the entire range of each variable, enabling them to learn patterns without bias toward any particular farming practice level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 4: \n",
    "Figure 4 examines the distribution of four categorical variables in the dataset: country, region, crop type, and adaptation strategies. The country distribution shows that the dataset includes ten major agricultural nations, with USA, Australia, and China being the most represented (approximately 1000 instances each), followed by Nigeria, India, Canada, Argentina, France, Russia, and Brazil with roughly equal representation. This geographic diversity ensures the dataset captures agricultural practices across different continents and climate zones. The regional distribution reveals that South and Northeast regions dominate with approximately 750 instances each, followed by North, Central, Punjab, Victoria, New South Wales, East, South West, and Ontario regions. The crop type distribution demonstrates remarkable diversity, with ten major crops represented almost equally: wheat, cotton, vegetables, corn, rice, sugarcane, fruits, soybeans, barley, and coffee, each appearing approximately 1000 times. This balanced representation across diverse crops from grains to cash crops to vegetables ensures our classifiers can learn patterns applicable to multiple agricultural contexts. Finally, the adaptation strategies variable shows that water management is by far the most common strategy with approximately 2000 instances, followed by no adaptation, drought-resistant crops, organic farming, and crop rotation with roughly equal representation around 1500 instances each. The prevalence of water management strategies reflects the critical\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 6:\n",
    "Figure 6 presents scatter plots showing the relationships between four key variables and crop yield, with points color-coded by yield category (red for Low, yellow for Medium, green for High). The temperature versus yield plot reveals a notable pattern with a conspicuous gap in the 10-20°C range where no data points appear, suggesting either missing data or that crops in this dataset are not grown in that temperature range. Higher temperatures (20-35°C) are associated with higher yields, as evidenced by the concentration of green points in this region. The precipitation versus yield plot shows a more uniform distribution across all precipitation levels (0-3000mm), with all three yield categories well-mixed throughout the range, suggesting that precipitation alone is not a strong predictor of yield category. The soil health versus yield plot demonstrates the clearest separation among all four plots, with low yields (red) predominantly appearing in the 30-60 soil health range, medium yields (yellow) in the 50-80 range, and high yields (green) concentrated in the 60-100 range. This strong visual separation indicates that soil health is likely to be one of the most important features for our classification models. The irrigation access versus yield plot shows moderate separation, with low yields more common at lower irrigation levels and high yields appearing across all irrigation levels but with slightly higher concentration at higher access percentages. These scatter plots provide crucial insights into which features will be most predictive for classifying crop yields, with soil health emerging as the strongest individual predictor, followed by temperature and irrigation access, while precipitation shows weaker discriminative power.\n"
